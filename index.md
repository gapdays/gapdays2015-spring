# Second [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days
## {{ site.description }}, {{ site.location }}

This meeting is a developers' meeting which will focus on stabilizing HPC-GAP.
Our goal is to work towards a beta-release of HPC-GAP with improved documentation
which helps package authors to gradually port their packages.
Furthermore we want to work out a roadmap for reintegrating HPC-GAP into the main development line.

#### GAP Days in general

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to influence the future
development of GAP by initiating and contributing to discussions and coding
sprints. As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the
meetings usually offer good opportunities for people to work on their own
packages. To streamline each meeting the organizers will usually suggest a few
main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meeting is on code
development, with talks only playing a minor role. At the end of the week, we
would be happy to hear about any progress you made.
